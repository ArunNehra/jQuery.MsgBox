# jQuery MsgBox

0.6.0 BETA

## What is it?

Firefox style simplist dialog form.


## How to use this?

It's quiet simple.

```html
<script src="jquery.lastest.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.msgbox.min.js"></script>
```

    alert("i'm alert");
    -> $.alert("i'm alert");

    confirm("Are you sure?");
    -> $.confirm("Are you sure?");

    prompt("please text me.");
    -> $.prompt("please text me.");

## Wait! YOU MUST SEE BEFORE USE THIS PLUGIN,
this plugin is can't replace as javascript standard function (alert, etc.)
because, this plugin cannot wait user action while showing dialog.
If you want get user's action, put a callback function in next of message param.
when user clicked in a dialog button, such as OK or cancel, msgbox will call your defined function.

Please don't..
```js
form.submit=function(){
    //All MsgBox function returns MsgBox Container Object. so it'll return always true.
    if($.confirm('Are you sure to save it?')){
        return true;//Page will changed without your confirm.
    }
    return false;
}
```
**So, what can I do?**

```js
form.submit=function(){
    if(!form.confirm){//Use variables or DOM objects or whatever you want.
        $.confirm('Are you sure to save it?',function(answer){
            form.confirm=answer;
            if(answer) form.submit();//submit again to verify confirm value.
        });
        return false;//You should use this line to prevent page changes.
    }else return true;
}
```
* You can use another solution to solve this.

## OK. so, How to use with callback function?

jQuery.MsgBox can add your callback function for provide next action after user clicked.
It's Very simple.

```js
$.alert("click me.",function(){
    $.alert('you are clicked!');
});
```
```js
$.confirm("press OK or Cancel.",function(bool){
    $.alert('you are clicked '+(bool?'OK':'cancel'));
});
```
```js
$.prompt("what's your name?",function(string){
    $.alert('your name is '+string);
});
```

## Hey, I'm using IE version under 9, Msgbox flicking when showing MsgBox. What's happening?

Sorry. that is prevent changing width dynamically after center align on IE. I don't know it is bug, but I'll figure out it.

## Goals

 - More Simplify and Optimization.
 - Less Size and Unresolved Issues.
 - **Use CSS instead of inline style!!!**
 - **All Methods will returns Deferred Object instead of DOM Container** ??? Well, I'll think about it.

## What's new?

### 0.5.0

 - Use &lt;div&gt; with white-space: pre; instead of &lt;pre&gt; for more better view of MsgBox with CSS Framework such as Bootstrap.
 - Remove Browser compatibility for position:fixed is buggy under IE 7, so this will support jQuery over 1.8! I'll never test freaking old browsers.
 - Remove jQuery in my repository, Use any available jQuery CDN in demo instead.

### 0.6.0

 - Auto resizing added. Msgbox will show full size when window size less than alert size, If not, revert original size.
